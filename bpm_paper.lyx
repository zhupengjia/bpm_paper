\begin_layout Abstract
Beam-line equipment was upgraded for experiment E08-027 (g2p) in Hall A
 at Jefferson Lab.
 Two beam position monitors (BPMs) were necessary to measure the beam position
 and angle at the target.
 A new BPM receiver was designed and built to handle the low beam currents
 (50-100 nA) used for this experiment.
 Two new super-harps were installed for calibrating the BPMs.
 In addition to the existing fast raster system, a slow raster system was
 installed.
 Before and during the experiment, these new devices were tested and debugged,
 and their performance was also evaluated.
 In order to achieve the required accuracy (1-2 mm in position and 1-2 mrad
 in angle at the target location), new methods were developed for analyzing
 the data of the BPMs and harps, as well as reconstructing the beam position
 and angle event by event at the target location.
 The calculated beam position will be used in the data analysis to accurately
 determine the kinematics for each event.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A polarized ammonia (
\begin_inset Formula $NH_{3}$
\end_inset

) target was used for the first time in Hall A for the g2p experiment 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "g2pproposal"

\end_inset

.
 It operated at a low temperature of 1K and a strong transverse magnetic
 field of either 5 T or 2.5 T.
 A high electron beam current would cause significant target polarization
 drop due to target temperature rising and ionization radiation to the target
 material 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Crabb67"

\end_inset

.
 To minimize depolarization, the beam current was limited to below 100 nA
 and a raster system was used to spread the beam spot out to a larger area.
 The transverse magnetic field in the target region would cause the beam
 to be deflected downward when the beam enters the target region.
 To compensate for this, two chicane magnets were placed in front of the
 target to pre-bend the beam upwards.
 Due to the low beam current and tight space limitations after the chicane
 magnets, the experimental accuracy goals for the position (1-2 mm) and
 angle (1-2 mrad) at the target were challenging to achieve.
 New beam-line devices and an associated readout electronics system were
 designed for the g2p experiment to accomplish these goals.
 Design details and the performance of the beam-line devices will be described
 in the following sections along with a discussion of a new analysis method
 determine the beam position and direction.

Beam position monitor (BPM)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The scattering angle of the outgoing lepton in deep inelastic scattering,
 which is defined with respect to the direction of the incident beam, is
 an important variable for obtaining meaningful physics results.
 Therefore, the position and direction of the beam, after being bent by
 the chicane magnetic field and spread out by the rasters, must be measured
 precisely.
 Two BPMs and two harps were installed for relative and absolute measurements
 of beam position and direction near the target, respectively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The BPM consists of four open-ended antennas for detecting the beam position;
 the measurement is non-invasive to the beam.
 The BPM chambers shown in Fig.

When the beam passes through the BPM chamber, each antenna receives an induced

 As shown in Fig.

, the BPM receiver collects and sends the signal to the regular Hall A DAQ
 system and another DAQ system designed for parity violation experiments,

.
 The new BPM receiver was designed by the JLab instrumentation group 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "mussonece652paper"

\end_inset

 in order to achieve the required precision at a level of 0.1 mm with a beam
 current as low as 50 nA.
 The regular DAQ system was connected to a 13-bit fastbus ADC (Lecroy ADC
 1881) with an integration time of 50 ns, which was triggered by a scattered
 electron event.
 The HAPPEX system was connected to an 18-bit ADC with an integration time
 of 875 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

s, which was triggered by a beam helicity signal at 1 kHz.
 The amplitude, 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, recorded in the ADC has the following relation with the BPM signal, 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
A\propto\phi\cdot10^{g/20},\label{eq:adcsignalvsantenna}

\begin_inset Formula $g$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The BPM receiver generates a large time delay for the output signals.
 The digital filter used in the receiver contributes 
\begin_inset Formula $1/175\,$
\end_inset

s delay time, which was the inverse of the bandwidth setting chosen for
 the filter.
 There is a 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim4\ \mu$
\end_inset

s delay as a result of finite processing times.
 The BPM can not provide event by event position because of this time delay,
 due to the high frequency fast raster system (discussed in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Raster-system"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The existed chicane dipole magnets ordained two BPMs must be installed after
 them.
 Because of the space limitation between the second chicane magnet and the
 target, the two BPMs were placed very close to each other.
 One was placed 95.5 cm upstream of the target while the other was placed
 69 cm upstream, making the distance between them only 26.5 cm.
 The short distance magnified the position uncertainty from the BPMs to
 target.

) controlled by a step motor 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "yan261"

\end_inset

 which can be moved in and out of the beam-line.
 The harps must be moved out of the beam-line when production data is being
 taken because they are invasive to the beam.
 The original position of the wires was surveyed before the experiment at
 a precision level of 0.1 mm.
 As the motor driver moved the fork through the beam, each wire received
 a signal, which was recorded for further analysis.
 The signals received from the wire and the step-counters from the motor
 driver were then sent to an amplifier and the DAQ.
 The amplification and the speed of the motor were adjustable for the purpose
 of optimizing the signals of each scan.
 Recorded data combined with the survey data was used to calculate the absolute
 beam position.

The positions measured by the two harps were used for calibrating the beam
 positions in the two BPMs.
 When the chicane magnets were on, beam did not pass straight through from
 the first harp to the second harp.
 BPM calibrations using two harps were only possible when the chicane magnets
 were off, i.e.
 in the straight-through settings.
 Since the BPM was calibrated in the local coordinate system, the calibration
 constants were independent from the settings of other instruments.
 To make sure that the calibration constants for the BPMs were still valid
 during the non-straight-through settings, the settings for the BPM receiver
 were kept the same as in the straight-through settings during production
 running.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The scan data from the harps was not reliable when the current of CW beam
 (100% duty factor) was lower than 100 nA due to the low signal-to-noise
 ratio.
 The harp scans were taken in pulsed mode at a current of a few 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

A, while the BPMs were used for production data taking in CW mode at a beam
 current of 50-100 nA.
 For a BPM calibration run, a harp scan was done first in pulsed mode, then
 a DAQ run was taken immediately to record the ADC value in CW mode without
 changing the beam position.
 The harp scan was then taken again in the pulsed mode to double check the
 beam position.
 The harp scan data was discarded and the scan was taken again if the beam
 position changed.

 In order to extract the beam position information, and eliminate the dependence
 on the beam current in equation (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin{eqnarray}
x_{d} & = & \frac{\phi_{x+}-\phi_{x-}}{\phi_{x+}+\phi_{x-}},\label{eq:diff/sum}\\
y_{d} & = & \frac{\phi_{y+}-\phi_{y-}}{\phi_{y+}+\phi_{y-}}.\label{eq:diff/sumy}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

Substituting equation (

) into equation (

LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:diff/sum"

\end_inset

) and equation (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

), they can be rewritten as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
x_{d}=\frac{\phi_{x+}-\phi_{x-}}{\phi_{x+}+\phi_{x-}}=\frac{2}{R}\frac{\rho cos(\theta-\theta_{0})}{1+\frac{\rho^{2}}{R^{2}}}=\frac{2}{R}\frac{x}{1+\frac{x^{2}+y^{2}}{R^{2}}},\label{eq:xb=000026xy}

\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho^{2}=x^{2}+y^{2}$
\end_inset

 When 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{2}+y^{2}\ll R^{2}$
\end_inset

, equations (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

) and (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

) can be simplified as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
x & = & \frac{R}{2}x_{d}=\frac{R}{2}\frac{\phi_{x+}-\phi_{x-}}{\phi_{x+}+\phi_{x-}},\nonumber \\

\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

Equation (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:litexyb=000026xy"

\end_inset

) can be used in the simple case when the beam is near the center of the
 beam pipe.
 When the beam is far from the center, equation (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

) is no longer valid.
 For the g2p experiment, the beam was rastered to have a diameter of about
 2 cm at the target.
 Combining equation (

reference "eq:xb=000026xy"

\end_inset

) with (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:yb=000026xy"

\end_inset

) the beam position can be calculated as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
x & = & Rx_{d}(\frac{1}{x_{d}^{2}+y_{d}^{2}}-\frac{1}{\sqrt{x_{d}^{2}+y_{d}^{2}}}\sqrt{\frac{1}{x_{d}^{2}+y_{d}^{2}}-1}),\nonumber \\
y & = & Ry_{d}(\frac{1}{x_{d}^{2}+y_{d}^{2}}-\frac{1}{\sqrt{x_{d}^{2}+y_{d}^{2}}}\sqrt{\frac{1}{x_{d}^{2}+y_{d}^{2}}-1}).\label{eq:realxy}

 In this way the method using equation (

) can correct the non-linearity effect caused by equation (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:litexyb=000026xy"

\end_inset

).
 Assuming the slow raster spreads the beam uniformly by changing the slow
 raster magnet current, the slow raster magnet current can be used to check
 this non-linearity.
 The slow raster magnet current can be converted to the displaced position,
 more details about the conversion will be discussed in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Linearityraster"

\end_inset

 shows the linearity of the corrected equation with the position converted
 from the slow raster, compared with position calculated from the diff/sum
 equation.
 In order to avoid the delay time caused by the BPM receiver, the waveform
 of the slow raster x-magnet was set to 20 Hz sinusoidal for this study.
 The slow raster y-magnet and the fast raster were kept off.
 Since the BPM has a 
\begin_inset Formula $45^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 rotation with the Hall coordinate, the beam was sweeping in the diagonal
 direction in the BPM local coordinate, which has the largest non-linearity
 effect from the Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

(c).
 The result shows that the corrected equation has a better linearity than
 the diff/sum one.
 Better solution may use a corrected algorithm during the benchmark test
 of the hardware

It is easy to transport the position from the BPMs to the target by using
 a linear transportation method for the straight through setting.
 For the settings with a transverse magnetic field at the target, the linear
 transportation method can not be used since the beam is bent near the target.
 A simulation package was constructed to simulate the behavior of the beam.
 Polynomial curve fittings were used for simulated data to generate the
 transport functions in order to transport the beam from the two BPMs to
 the target (Fig.

Conversion factor for the fast raster
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The conversion for the fast raster was the same as for the slow raster.
 The low pass filter for the BPM was set to a higher value than the frequency
 of the fast raster to see the beam shape at the BPM formed by the fast
 raster.
 For a higher frequency filter, a larger beam current was needed to get
 a clear pattern.
 The beam current chosen for calibrating the fast raster was near 300 nA,
 which was the safety limit for the target.
 The beam shape formed by the fast raster is shown in Fig.

\begin_layout Section
Uncertainty
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The uncertainty of the final beam position at the target for each event
 contains several contributions: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The first part comes from the uncertainty of the calibration constant.
 It includes the BPM resolution for the DAQ runs used for the calibration,
 the uncertainty of the harp data corresponding to each calibration, and
 the survey uncertainties for the BPMs and harps.
 It contributes about 0.7 mm for the uncertainty of the position and 0.7 mrad
 for the uncertainty of the angle.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The uncertainty on the pedestal is the largest uncertainty for the beam
 position measurement, contributing about 0.7
\begin_inset Formula $\sim$
\end_inset

1.5 mm to the uncertainty of the position and 0.7
\begin_inset Formula $\sim$
\end_inset

1.5 mrad to the uncertainty of the angle.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The uncertainties from the BPM survey need to be included, since the production
 data and the calibration data were taken at different beamline settings
 when the equipment was moved.
 They contribute 0.5 mm to the uncertainty of the position.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The uncertainty from the magnetic field map of the target was considered
 for the settings with the target magnet field.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The uncertainties due to the size conversion of the rasters were also included.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The position uncertainty was magnified by a factor of 5 at the target because
 of the short distance between the two BPMs.
 For example, in the straight through setting, if the uncertainty at BPM
 A is 0.2 mm, and at BPM B is 0.27 mm, the uncertainty at the target is 1.1
 mm for position and 1.3 mrad for angle.
 The uncertainty for the position at the target was around 1
\begin_inset Formula $\sim$
\end_inset

2 mm, while the uncertainty for the angle was 1
\begin_inset Formula $\sim$
\end_inset

2 mrad.

Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
JLab g2p experiment used a transversely polarized 
\begin_inset Formula $NH_{3}$
\end_inset

 target for the first time in Hall A.
 It put a limit of below 100 nA on the electron beam current and required
 a slow raster to spread beam to a large area.
 Two chicane magnets were used to compensate the strong transverse magnetic
 field.
 Beam-line equipment, including the BPMs, harps and associated readout system,
 were upgraded to allow precision measurements of the beam position at low
 current (50-100 nA).
 A software filter was used to reduce noise in the BPMs.
 A corrected equation was used to compensate the non-linearity caused by
 the diff/sum equation.
 The harp data and the linear fit between the bpm signal and the beam current
 were used to extract the calibration constant of the BPM.
 To account for the strong target magnetic field effect, transport functions
 were generated to transport the beam position from the BPMs to the target.
 The beam position in the x-y plane and the angle at the target location
 are extracted event-by-event by combining information from the BPMs and
 the signals from the rasters.
 The performance of the new devices (BPMs, harps and slow rasters) were
 presented along with an analysis of systematic uncertainties.
