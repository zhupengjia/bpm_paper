  Abstract                 = {Abstract We describe a dynamically polarized target that has been utilized for two electron scattering experiments in Hall A at Jefferson Lab. The primary components of the target are a new, high cooling power 4He evaporation refrigerator, and a re-purposed, superconducting split-coil magnet. It has been used to polarize protons in irradiated \{NH3\} at a temperature of 1&#xa0;K and at fields of 2.5 and 5.0&#xa0;T. The performance of the target material in the electron beam under these conditions will be discussed. Maximum polarizations of 28% and 95% were obtained at those fields, respectively. To satisfy the requirements of both experiments, the magnet had to be routinely rotated between angles of 0Â°, 6Â°, and 90Â° with respect to the incident electron beam. This was accomplished using a new rotating vacuum seal which permits rotations to be performed in only a few minutes.},
